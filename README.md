## Introduction

Bitcoin, as a digital asset, exhibits significant price volatility. Understanding and estimating this volatility is crucial for investors, traders, and researchers. This project provides a comprehensive analysis through three detailed Jupyter notebooks, each corresponding to a specific method or approach discussed in individual blog posts.

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains the three Jupyter notebooks.
- `data/`: Directory where the fetched data will be stored.
- `fetch_data.py`: Python script to download the required Bitcoin data.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists all the Python packages required to run the notebooks.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bitcoin-volatility-estimation.git
   cd bitcoin-volatility-estimation
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data Fetching

Before running the notebooks, you need to fetch the Bitcoin data:

```bash
python fetch_data.py
```

This script will download the necessary data and save it in the `data/` directory.

## Usage

1. **Launch Jupyter Notebook:**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. **Open the notebooks:**

   Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open the notebook you're interested in.

3. **Run the analyses:**

   Execute the cells sequentially to reproduce the results.
